                    <p style = "line-height: 100%; margin: 40px">Welcome to this page. I am Curtis Tsang who is now studying at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and aiming for a Bachelor degree in computer engineering or possibly computer science.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p style = "line-height: 100%; margin: 40px">I spent my secondary school life at Queen's College and picked posts such as Deputy Head Libray Prefect and Counselling Prefect which allowed me to gain experience in working with different stakeholders at the campus.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p style = "line-height: 100%; margin: 40px">I am interested in exploring different skills in data analysis and visualization. Discovering the hidden relationship among data and expressing them clearly give me great sense of satisfaction. Moreover, I also try to learn ways to effectively express ideas through photography.</p>
